Take a moment to learn about the remarkable journey of Michael Ghai Tong Aroffe. Born in South Sudan during a time of civil war & tribal conflict on 27 May 1993, Michael faced incredible challenges, including the loss of his father and displacement from his community. However, these hardships only strengthened his resilience and determination. Despite these difficulties, he pursued his education and eventually earned a scholarship to study Journalism and Mass Communication at Chandigarh University, India. Also, Michael has studied International Peacekeeping at the Kofi Annan Peace Training Centre and Peace Operations Training Institute under the UNMISS sponsorship.

Throughout his career, Michael has been involved in broadcast media, public service, and activism. He has served in various roles, from being a Private Secretary in the Jonglei State Government at the Ministry of Information and Communication to working as a Reporter, Presenter, and Program Producer at Radio Jonglei 95.9 FM and a Program Manager at Radio Duk Padiet 96.6 FM. His leadership skills have been instrumental in empowering the youth in his community to reach their full potential, and he continues to be a guiding force toward a common goal.

As the Information Secretary at the Jonglei Civil Society Network from 2022 to 2024, Michael worked tirelessly with different stakeholders to advocate for positive change within the society. Together, they harnessed the power of collective action to strive for a more just and equitable future for all.

In 2021, Michael was selected as a Peace Fellow at the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). This experience broadened his perspective on the interconnectedness of our world and the vital importance of fostering peace and unity on a global scale. It serves as a constant reminder that we have the power to create a brighter future for generations to come.

Reflecting upon his experiences and the challenges he has overcome, Michael resonates with the famous quote by Martin Luther King Jr.: "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." He understands that the journey towards social change requires not only personal dedication but also the support and collaboration of others. It's through collective action and a shared vision that lasting impact and inspiring change are possible.

In conclusion, Michael's journey as a volunteer teacher, community leader, and advocate for change has taught him the power of service, the value of collaboration, and the importance of empowering others. His various roles and experiences have shown him that true success is not measured by personal achievements but by the positive impact we have on the lives of others. Driven by this understanding, Michael Ghai is more motivated than ever to continue working towards a more just and equitable world for all.
